//! This crate provides a simple TokenBucket object for use in rate-
//! limiting. 
//! 
//! # Short Example Program
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use tokenbucket::TokenBucket;
//! use tokenbucket::TokenAcquisitionResult;
//! use std::{thread, time};
//! 
//! // Will acquire tokens at the specified rate for the specified duration.
//! // After each acquisition, the AcquisitionResult will be printed.
//! fn run(bucket: &mut TokenBucket, rate: u32, duration: u32) {
//!     for _ in 0..=(rate * duration) {
//!         // Acquire 1 token from the bucket.
//!         let acquisition: TokenAcquisitionResult = bucket.acquire(1.0);
//! 
//!         // Determine the acquisition result.
//!         match acquisition {
//!             Ok(rate)  => println!("rate/allow: {}, true", rate),
//!             Err(rate) => println!("rate/allow: {}, false", rate),
//!         }
//!         
//!         // Sleep for enough time to match the desired rate/second.
//!         thread::sleep(time::Duration::from_micros(
//!             (1000000.0 * (1.0 / rate as f64)) as u64,
//!         ));
//!     }
//! }
//! 
//! fn main() {
//!     // Create the TokenBucket object
//!     let mut token_bucket: TokenBucket = TokenBucket::new(5.0, 100.0);
//! 
//!     // Start of by acquiring 60 tokens per second for 10 seconds.
//!     run(&mut token_bucket, 60, 10);
//! 
//!     // Slow down to 2 tokens per second for 10 seconds.
//!     run(&mut token_bucket, 2, 10);
